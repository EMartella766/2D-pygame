# A 2D street fighter like project I made using Pygame, featuring input handling, game state management, sprite animations, basic gameplay mechanics and a main menu.

Small demo of the gameplay showcasing some basic attacks I added, alongside healthbars, sprite animations and a hitbox system.

This here is the main menu showing a button system which can be used to navigate within the menu also providing an option for the player to toggle between their preferred input method. 
When the play button is pressed, the screen switches to the character select screen, showcasing some additional GUI elements I have implemented.

Several features I have shown are still experimental and may not function as intended, with additional bugs to be fixed. Despite this, the project proved to be a very valuable experience, particularly introducing me to OOP principles, which significantly improved the maintainability and reusability of the codebase. 

The project also provided the opportunity to engage with the Pygame development community, where discussions with more experienced developers helped me debug code as well as learn new technical concepts.

SETTING UP THE GAME

[ 1 ] Import Pygame

In every pygame videogame we need to start our code with pygame.init() and end it ( or close it ) with pygame.exit()

[ 2 ] Setting up the screen 
 We first need to set up the window of the game and we can first start by stating two variables, HEIGHT and WIDTH.
We can then assign values to each of these and set how wide and high we want our game to look.

we can create a new variable called "window" and use the set_mode function to actually make the window and set our dimension
values.

To add a title to our game, we can use the "set_caption" function - pygame.display.set_caption("TITLE")
Our next step is to add the main game loop. Since if we try run the program, It is going to appear for s brief instance.
Thus we need some sort of loop to repeat our code. I used a while loop and said that while the game is running = True,
The game is going to keep running until this condition is not longer met. 

However, if a player closes the window tab the "running = True" condition is no longer true. To check if the player has 
closed the tab we can use something known as the event handler. First you start by using a FOR loop to repeatedly check
the event of closing the tab. "If" the event type is equivalent to quitting, running is now set to False.

running = True
while running:
   for event in pygame.event.get():
     if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
        running = False

[ 3 ] Adding a background image
We can first start by loading the image in the program by firstly creating a variable and using the function
pygame.image.load (file address) .
       
       background = pygame.image.load (assets/cell arena.png)
Now we can create a function to draw our image on the "WINDOW"

def draw()
   window.blit(background, (0,0)) 
We want to draw our backgound on our window using the blit function, We then need to set the coordinates to (0,0),
which represents the top left hand corner of our screen.

We now just put our function onto the main game loop.

However the image I chose was not to scale with the window. Thus, we need to use the .scale function and assign it 
our chosen height and width.

scaled_background = pygame.transform.scale (background, (HEIGHT, WIDTH))

We now replace ( in the draw function ) background with scaled_background

def draw()
   scaled_background = pygame.transform.scale (background, (HEIGHT, WIDTH ))
   window.blit (scaled_background, (0,0))

Lastly we want to update our display by using the function

pygame.display.update()

Another last thing to add is that in order for display to run, all our functions need to be specified above the game loop
They then MUST be included within our game loop so that the program can keep performing the same functions repeatedly.

CREATING THE FIGHTERS!

[ 1 ] Create the CLASS FIGTHERZ

We first create the class "Fighters". We then need to add our constructor. We use this function which will be called auto
matically in order to build our objects. We then use the parameters self, the x coordinate, the y coordinate, width and 
height.

import pygame

class Fighters:

   def __init__(self,x,y):
     self.rect = pygame.Rect((x, y, w, h))
     
We then go back to main.py and create our two fighters.

fighter_1 = Fighters( 500, 375, 80, 180 ) => we are passing these values as arguments onto our constructor class.
fighter_2 = Fighters( 1500, 375, 80, 180 )

Now we go back to our class file and add a function to draw these rectangles:

def fighter_draw(self, surface):
  pygame.draw.rect( surface, (0,0,255), self.rect ) => surface corresponds to the window, (0,0,255) is Blue in RGB and 
                                                       self.rect is the attribute which describes the position and the
                                                       dimensions of the object. To summarise you are using pygame.draw 
                                                       function to draw whats inside the brackets

Now you need to add the function onto the main game loop:

running = True
while running:
  
  fighter_1.fighter_draw(window) => window acts as an argument and it is passed onto the fighter_draw function into the 
  fighter_2.fighter_draw(window)    parameter surface.

PARALLAX BACKGROUND 

To add depth as well as a more 3 dimensional effect to our background it would be a good idea to use a method called
parallax images. This consists of having different images ( or layers ) so that when they are put together they all 
run at different speeds. Instead of a single plain bg image I will replace the bg with several images.

To start with you need to create a list where we can store all of our images. We can then use a for loop to load each image
in the program and then once these images have been loaded into the program we can used the .append function to
add our images into our images list

BG_IMGS = []
for i in range (1,11):
   IMG = pygame.image.load (f"assets/parallax_demon_woods_pack/layers/parallax-{i}.png") => {i} allows you to use variable 
   BG_IMGS.append(IMG)                                                               i in the for loop and update the {i} for
                                                      each loop iteration. This is so that instead of making 4 statements just to load each image in, the for loop allows you to load
                                                      all of them in at once without any extra lines of codes. Each time an iteration happens the {i} is going to increment by 1
                                                      so instead of having several statements with parallax-1 then parallax-2, it will instead just do parallax-1 and then
                                                      for the next iteration it is going to increment the i counter by 1, resulting in parallax-2.

the "f" instead allows you to take the i variable and put into the our string. In this case the name of the images
We now need to actually draw the images on the screen. We can make a function and use anopther for loop to draw each image on our
window.

def image_draw():
   for i in BG_IMGS: => i is representing the items in our list, so every time i increases the program is going to move onto the next
                       index or position and draw the next image.
     window.blit(i (0,0)) => 0,0 are the coordinates for left hand top corner of the screen

However, if the image is not bug enough it might result in the window having a blank section. Thus, we need to draw each image next to each other

BG_WIDTH = BG_IMGS[0].get_width() => Getting the image width of the first item in our list ( since all our images are going to have the same width)
                                       
def image_draw():
 for x in range(3): =>We want to have 3 of the same images next to each other
   for i in BG_IMGS:
     window.blit(i (x * BG_WIDTH,0)) => for every iteration of x we are going to be moving BG_WIDTH across.

Now that we have loaded in the images, there was a small issue - the images weren't scaled to the screen and were just small images in the top left
hand corner of my screen. However this was a rather simple thing to resolve. All we had to do was take the imagaes loaded and scale them by
a chosen width and our set height. We can then store these images onto a variable called scaled_bg and add them to ur list.

BG_IMGS = []
for i in range ( 1,11 ):
   IMG = pygame.image.load (f"assets/parallax-{i}.png")
   scaled_bg = pygame.transform.scale (IMG, (1300, HEIGHT))
   BG_IMGS.append(scaled_bg)

Once the images were loaded in with the correct scale, the framerate as well as the speed of the two fighters seemed to be very slow, with a 
very high imput lag. Thus, after loading the image we need to add the function .convert_alpha(). This allows the program to create a new copy of the surface
with our chosen resolution. The new surface will be more suitable for quicker blitting ( so drawing the images on the window ).


In order for the images to actually move we need a variable called scroll. This is going to be our change in x coordinate when we are moving
right and left.

scroll = 0

BG_IMGS = []
for i in range (1,3):
   IMG = pygame.image.load (f"assets/parallax_demon_woods_pack/layers/parallax-{i}.png") 
   BG_IMGS.append(IMG)  

def image_draw():
  for x in range(3):
    for i in BG_IMGS:
      window.blit(i ((x * BG_WIDTH) - scroll ,0))


#under main game loop
#check if button pressed

key = pygame.key.get_pressed() => Here we are checking if the keys a and d have been pressed then we are going to be either incrementing or
if key[pygame.K_a] and dx > 0:    decreasing the value of scroll. We are also adding another condition which checks that if the x coordinate
   dx -= 5                        gets below 0 or above 2000 pixels then the player is not allowed to scroll anymore. We are pretty much adding
if key[pygame.K_d] and dx < 2000: some boundaries to the game
   dx += 5

Now that all the images have been loaded in we can still see that we are still having a static background. To give the parallax effect to our
background we need to give each image a different speed. We can do this by creating a new variable called speed and set it to 0. We can then set an initial speed in our
for loop so each time an iteration happens we have an initial speed. In our indented for loop we can then call our index ( x ), in this case the speed
and put it in our window.blit brackets. In our indented for loop every time an image is being drawn ( or in each iteration) our speed is going to be
incremented by a certain value. So the first image, for instance is going to have a speed of 0.5 and our next is going to have an incremented 
value of 0.7.

Extra things to add:
Character selection screen - existing solutions - mortal kombat
Maybe a main lobby - existing solutions roblox
currency system - unlikely- each time a move lands then a certain amount of currency is awarded to the player - could make a function which calculates a sum for each player and returns it;
loading screen; - will probably involve a code which just implements a video in the game;
put a cooldown after each move has been executed;
projectiles;
in game shop;
In game sound effects + music.
existing solutions - jojo arcade

PLAYER CONTROLS + CHARACTER MOVEMENT!!

To start with we need to create a new method and we are going to define it as fighter_move() and we are going to be adding our first parameter
"self". We can now set a speed and assign it a value ( in my case 12 ). Next we are going to be adding our change in x and our change in y and both 
assign them values of 0.

def fighter_move(self,width,height):
		speed = 12
		gravitational_field = 1
		change_x = 0
		change_y = 0

Now that we have created our new method we need to check for user input using specific input and adjust our speed and change in x so that player
is able to move left and right. We then need to update our x coordinate

button = pygame.key.get_pressed()

if button[pygame.K_d] :
	change_x = speed  => if a player presses the d key then our change in x is going to be positive and it is going to be moving in the x axis
			     at a positive speed.
if button[pygame.K_a]:
	change_x = -speed  => if the player presses the a key then our change in x is going to be moving towards the -ve x coordinate values, so we
                              assign the change_x a negative speed.

#updating x coordinate
self.rect.x += change_x

However even though we can move, we are also moving outside of the screen. Thus we need to set some boundaries.

if self.rect.left < 0:      => if the left side of the rectangle is less than 0 ( so it reached the left hand side of the window ) then our
	self.rect.left = 0     rectangle is going to stay at the x coordinate 0.
if self.rect.right > width:
	self.rect.right = width => If the right hand side of the rectangle reached the right hand side of the screen ( so if the x coordinate is
                                   now greater than our screen width, then our right hand side is going to have the x coordinate of the screen width
                             
To not get any errors remember to put the parameter width and in the main.py go to fighter_1 and pass in the width of the screen as an argument.


Now that we have tackled moving right and left, we need to add jumping. This is quite a similar process since we first need to check for user input
for the w key ( this is going to be the jump button for player_1 ). However we first need to set some new attributes in our constructor. We are
first going to add a velocity in the y axis and set it to 0. 

self.velocity_y = 0

if button[pygame.K_w]:
  self.velocity_y = -24 => velocity is negative as subtracting y values moves the player up the y-axis in pygame.

However now that we can jump we also need to add gravity to bring our player down when he jumps, else he is going to move up for infinity.
We set a new variable gravitational_field = 1 in our fighter_move function. Once we set gravity we need to update the change_y and 
the self.velocity_y

change_y += self.velocity_y  => change_y ( y coordinate ) is going to be incremented by self.velocity_y by a value of -24.
self.velocity_y += gravitational_field  => the y coordinate velocity is going to be incremented by the gravitational field by a value of 1.
We now need to go to our section where we update both the x and y of our rectangle.


self.rect.x += change_x 
self.rect.y += change_y

However, if we try run it we can notice that our player is able to move up outside of the screen, jump as many times as they want and things
such as spamming the w key to go up infinitely. Therefore we need to add some kind of trigger. We are going to be doing this by setting a new attribute
in our contructor function and call it self.jumping and assign it the boolean False.

In our if statement to check if the key has been pressed we can say that:
 if button[pygame.K_w] and self.jumping == False:
    self.velocity_y = -24
    self.jumping = True

This is saying that if are pressing the w key and we are not jumping then we are allowed to jump.

However if we try run it again we can see that the player is just going to fall of the ground. Thus we need to set a boundary on the ground.

if self.rect.bottom + change_y > height - 120:
        velocity_y = 0
	change_y = height - 120 - self.rect.bottom
	self.jumping = False

Pretty much, if the x coordinate of the bottom of the rectangle + the change_y is greater than the height - 120 ( which is how tall the platform 
is from the ground [ height - 120 ]) then we are not allowed to jump anymore. Our velocity is going to decrease to 0 our self.jumping is going to 
be set to false and our change_y is going to be the difference between the height of the platform and the x coordinate of the bottom of the
rectangle.

Once again to not get any errors we need to add height as a parameter in our move function as arguments

An instance variable is a variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks. Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated, and are accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class. Access modifiers can be given to the instance variable.







if self.rect.left + change_x < 0:
			change_x = 0 - self.rect.left
		elif self.rect.right + change_x > width:
			change_x = width - self.rect.right
========================================================================================================================

self.index += 1
        if self.index >= len(self.images):
            self.index = 0
        self.image = self.images[self.index]
ANIMATING THE PLAYER

Issue encountered -  How to link frame index as well as row counter to moves on the dictionary
Possible solution: When a key is pressed assign frame index as well as the frame counter to specific key corresponding to move ( so linking all the frames for a specific move )
Need a function to assign each move (key pressed ) to a specific key in the dictionary
Thing to add: need to put a delay between each image
Thing to add: Add a cooldown import time package for python will handle cooldowns.
Thing to add: In game currency systemm - name: "Social credits"
 - Issue encountered: How do you make a storing system for the money;

Thing to add: Sound effects - function sound effects
make a dictionary so each move linked to a specific sound file
